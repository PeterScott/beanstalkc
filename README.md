beanstalkc is a simple beanstalkd client library for
Python. [beanstalkd](http://kr.github.com/beanstalkd/) is a fast,
distributed, in-memory workqueue service.

beanstalkc depends on [PyYAML](http://pyyaml.org/), but there are ways
to avoid this dependency.  See Appendix A of the tutorial for details.
